## About Ch√°k·π£uAI

The Ch√°k·π£uAI project aims to develop an **open-source, AI-powered assistant** to support ophthalmologists in diagnosing and managing various eye diseases, including:

* Diabetic Retinopathy
* Glaucoma
* Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Using state-of-the-art deep learning models, Ch√°k·π£uAI provides functionalities such as:

* **Classification** of retinal diseases (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma).
* **Detection** of abnormalities (e.g., microaneurysms, haemorrhages).
* **Retinal Segmentation** (e.g., optic disc and cup).
* **Volumetric Analysis** of fluid in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.
* **Risk Prediction** for disease progression.

These capabilities are intended to be integrated into a unified platform to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in **low-resource settings**.
